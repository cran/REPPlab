LOG of the CHANGES in the package REPPlab

Version 0.2:
-----------------------------------
* EPPlab changes: 
* Created the class "PseudoRandomNumbers" (in package javalain.math) in which there are two static methods
   - public static void createGenerator (long seed) - to create a random generator of numbers.
   - public static void destroyGenerator (long seed) - to destroy a random generator of numbers.
   - public static double random () - to generate a number between [0 1[

* Replaced all items "Math.random()" in project with "PseudoRandomNumbers.random()"
* Create a random number generator during the first function call
* Destroy the RNG when leaving the java program
* Friedman subfunction does not work, so they are commented out

* REPPlab changes:
* EPPlab is now included as one jar file, instead of three subfiles
* A random number will be passed to EPPlab as a seed (so, EPPlab results are 'seedable' from within R)
* The typo in the default settings for the option PPindex in the EPPlab function has been fixed

Version 0.1:
------------------------------------
* First build and CRAN submission
